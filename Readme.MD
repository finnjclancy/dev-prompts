## Problem <br>
### We reuse prompts when talking to LLMs within our IDEs <br><br>

## Purpose of this repo <br>
- This repo is connected to a VS Code extension <br>
- When you use the extension all of the directories and files within this repo will be added to the root of your project
- You can then copy and paste the prompt be it a template, a system prompt, or something you reuse
